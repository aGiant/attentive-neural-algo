# Attentive Neural Processes for Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Milestone Test

I have implemented a deep Q-network with a Simple Neural Attentive MetaLearner as the underlying network. A small demo can be seen by cloning the repo and running test.py with the appropriate packages installed (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, trfl). Since the dataset is private, it is simply randomly generated data with the same dimensions as the actual dataset.
